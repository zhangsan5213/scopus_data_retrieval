# Scopus data retrieval with Egde

***Your university must have SUBSCRIBED to Scopus first!***

This is no malicious data scrapping, but a tool to help you download csvs from Scopus.

This code splits the results of an institution (Tianjin University used as in *config.py*) by author names using the author name panel to bypass the 2000 limit for csv export.

To use this script, store in advance the search that you would like to retrieve data from.
